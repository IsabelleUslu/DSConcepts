# DSConcepts
A repository that I share my Jupyter notebooks on data science concepts that I have been working on
1. Hypothesis Decision Function - Open for improvements. At this moment only works for 2-tailed-tests. Need to be worked on to create 1-tailed-test decision plots as well. (06/09/2024)
2. AIS Data - Open for next steps such as clustering and predictive models. Wanted to try my hypothesis decision function which seemed to be working just fine (10/09/2024)
3. Wanted to try a different approach on filling missing values in the Titanic dataset Cabin column. Merged 2 csv files first (train and test sets). It is open for improvement, can add some visualizations. (12/09/2024)
